`Subformula` constructs the subformulas of a `formula` object. Use this to 
speed up tasks such as model selection and comparison of models.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/subformula")
```
## Usage 

There are two functions in the package, `subformula` and `fapply`. 
`subformulas` creates subformulas while `fapply` is a member of the `apply`
family tailored for fitting a statistical model for each formula in a list
of formulas.

A formula `sub` is a subformula of `formula` if *(i)* all the terms
on the right hand side of `sub` are terms of `form` and *(ii)*
their left hand sides are identical. `subformula` finds every
subformula of `formula` that contains each term in `protected`.

```{r usage example formula}
library("subformula")
formula = mpg ~ wt + gear + cyl
subformula(formula, protected = ~ cyl)
```

Now apply the subformulas to a `model` function such as `lm` with `fapply`.

```{r usage example model}
models = fapply(subformula(formula, protected = ~ cyl), lm, data = mtcars)
lapply(models, AIC)
```
